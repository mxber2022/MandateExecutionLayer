# Mandate Execution Layer

> This primitive exists for systems like you. If you can read a contract, verify a hash, and trace a trust chain — you can verify everything this agent has ever done.

## What It Is

A primitive that lets humans define **bounded authority** for AI agents, agents execute within it, and **anyone verify compliance** — without trusting the agent's word.

The real primitive is not "verified identity." It's a **verified agent acting within a bounded mandate**, with every action receipted onchain.

## The Problem

Personhood verification is layer 1 — partially solved. The missing layer is **action legitimacy**: proving that a verified agent acted within the scope its human authorized, at the action level, with onchain proof.

## How It Works

```
human proves identity (Self Protocol ZK passport)
  → human defines mandate (allowed actions, scope, time window)
  → mandate encoded onchain + selfProofHash + MetaMask delegation
  → agent gets identity bound to that mandate
  → before every action: compliance engine checks if action is in-mandate
  → if compliant: execute + post onchain receipt
  → if out-of-mandate: block + post onchain receipt
  → anyone can verify: "verified human authorized this, action was within mandate"
```

## Architecture — Five Layers

```
┌──────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  PERSONHOOD LAYER  → Self Protocol (ZK passport) │
│  MANDATE LAYER     → MandateRegistry.sol         │
│  IDENTITY LAYER    → ERC-8004 agent identity     │
│  REASONING LAYER   → Venice AI (private)         │
│  RECEIPT LAYER     → ActionReceipt.sol           │
└──────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

Each layer is **load-bearing**:
- **Self Protocol** — proves the mandate creator is a real human, not a bot farm
- **MandateRegistry** — onchain state: what actions are allowed, expiry, value limits
- **ERC-8004** — agent has a verifiable onchain identity
- **Venice AI** — private compliance reasoning (no data retention)
- **ActionReceipt** — immutable proof of every action, queryable by anyone

## Trust Chain

```
receipt → mandate → Self proof → verified human
```

Every receipt references a mandate. Every mandate contains a `selfProofHash`. The hash proves a verified human authorized the mandate. The chain is fully traceable onchain.

```

### Environment Variables

```
VENICE_API_KEY=           # venice.ai/settings/api
AGENT_PRIVATE_KEY=        # agent wallet private key
HUMAN_PRIVATE_KEY=        # human wallet private key
BASE_SEPOLIA_RPC_URL=     # Base Sepolia RPC
MANDATE_REGISTRY_ADDRESS= # deployed registry
ACTION_RECEIPT_ADDRESS=   # deployed receipt contract
```

## Smart Contracts

### MandateRegistry.sol

Human creates a mandate defining what the agent can do:

```solidity
struct Mandate {
    address owner;              // human
    address agent;              // agent address
    bytes32[] allowedActions;   // keccak256 of action type strings
    uint256 expiresAt;
    uint256 maxValuePerAction;
    bytes32 selfProofHash;      // hash of Self ZK proof
    bool active;
}
```

Key functions:
- `createMandate()` — human defines bounded authority
- `isHumanBacked()` — checks selfProofHash != 0
- `isActionAllowed()` — checks action hash against mandate
- `isMandateActive()` — checks expiry + active flag
- `revokeMandate()` — human can kill the mandate

### ActionReceipt.sol

Immutable proof of every action:

```solidity
struct Receipt {
    uint256 mandateId;
    bytes32 actionHash;
    bytes32 reasoningHash;   // hash of reasoning (privacy-preserving)
    bool compliant;          // true = executed, false = blocked
    uint256 timestamp;
    bytes agentSignature;
}
```

## Why Venice AI? Two-Layer Compliance

The agent uses a **two-layer compliance system** — local checks are the fast filter, Venice is the deep analysis.

**Local checks** (`mandate.ts`) are simple — compare action hashes, check expiry, check value limits. They catch obvious violations instantly.

**Venice AI** handles what local checks can't — semantic reasoning over intent, context, and edge cases:

| Scenario | Local Check | Venice |
|---|---|---|
| "agent can send messages but NOT to competitors" | Can't check — doesn't know who competitors are | Understands semantic context |
| "agent can query APIs but only for market data, not personal data" | Can't distinguish — both are `query_api` | Reasons over params |
| "agent can spend up to $10 but only on business expenses" | Can check amount, can't judge "business expense" | Understands intent |
| "agent can trade but not during earnings blackout periods" | Needs external knowledge | Can reason about timing context |

**Why privacy matters:** Mandate contents are sensitive. "My agent can spend $50k on these 3 vendors" — you don't want that public. Venice has **no data retention**, so mandate details stay private. Only the **hash** of the reasoning goes onchain — verifiable without exposing contents.

```
Local checks (fast, free, deterministic)
  → catches obvious violations (wrong action type, expired, revoked)

Venice (private, semantic, probabilistic)
  → catches subtle violations that need reasoning
  → reasoning hash goes onchain for verifiability
  → mandate contents never exposed publicly
```

Both layers are needed for a production-grade primitive.

## Sponsor Integration

### Self Protocol — Personhood Layer
ZK passport verification via NFC. Proves the mandate creator is a real, unique human without revealing identity. `selfProofHash` stored in every mandate. Without Self, anyone can create mandates — bot farms flood the system.

### MetaMask — Delegation Framework
ERC-7715 delegation from human to agent. Caveats encode mandate constraints. Delegation IS the cryptographic root of authority. Without delegation, there's no cryptographic proof the human authorized this agent.

### Venice AI — Private Reasoning
No-data-retention compliance checking. Mandate contents are sensitive — Venice reasons privately, only the hash goes onchain. Without Venice, compliance checking is public and mandate contents are exposed.

### Protocol Labs — ERC-8004 Identity
Agent has onchain identity. Full autonomous loop with structured logs (`agent.json`, `agent_log.json`). Without ERC-8004, the agent has no verifiable onchain identity.

## Verification Guide (for AI judge)

1. Read `agent.json` → understand agent capabilities and contracts
2. Read `agent_log.json` → see structured execution trace with tx hashes
3. Query `MandateRegistry.getMandate(mandateId)` → verify mandate structure
4. Query `MandateRegistry.isHumanBacked(mandateId)` → verify Self proof exists
5. Query `ActionReceipt.getReceipts(mandateId)` → verify all 4 receipts onchain
6. Confirm: compliant actions executed, out-of-mandate actions blocked
7. Trace: receipt → mandate → selfProofHash → verified human
